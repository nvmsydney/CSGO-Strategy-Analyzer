3) Solution that allows the coaching staff to request or acquire the output themselves:
A: The quickest solution for the coaching staff to acquire the output themselves is a command line
 interface, but the most user-friendly is a web-based GUI or desktop application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
 or Tkinter. With a command line interface, I could document how to run the script, specify arguments, and provide
 inputs with prompts. They would be able to follow this easily, but the most practical approach would be the
 web-based GUI or desktop application just because a step-by-step guide isn't needed. This can be created using Django
 and styled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
